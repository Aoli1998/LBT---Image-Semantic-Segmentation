# LBT---Image-Semantic-Segmentation
Learning by Teaching is a mechine learning method 
In this project, we propose to use the Learning-by-Teaching algorithm combined with various semantic segmentation algorithms. Learning-by-Teaching is a methodology that has great effectiveness in improving learning outcomes. LBT framework combines with multiple stages where first the teacher model learns, then teacher transfer knowledge to students. With feedback from students, the teacher further improves its model. Under this framework, we use Fully Convolutional Network and U-Net model to perform semantic segmentation tasks on multiple images. Our results show LBT has faster convergence and better performance than the original neural network and successfully solves image semantic segmentation problems.
